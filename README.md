# reactToDo

#How to use

You need installed npm and webpack to work with that project

#How install
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Pitmov/reactToDo.git
$ cd reactToDo
$ npm install
$ webpack-dev-server --progress --colors --config ./settings/webpack.config.js
```
After that goto http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/html and try. Good luck!
